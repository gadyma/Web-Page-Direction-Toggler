Single purpose
The 'Web Page Direction Toggler' extension allows users to easily switch the text direction of any webpage between left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) with a single click. This is particularly useful for users who read and write in languages that use different text directions, such as Hebrew and English.


Permission justification


The Active tab permission is necessary for the extension to interact with the currently active tab when the user clicks the extension icon. This is essential for toggling the text direction of the active webpage between left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL). Without this permission, the extension cannot determine or modify the content of the active tab.

The scripting permission is required to inject CSS styles directly into the active tab's webpage. This functionality is crucial for changing the text direction of the content displayed on the page, allowing users to switch between LTR and RTL text directions as needed.
